```{ruby}
require 'boxcars'
```

```{ruby}

# showcase Google Serp search
s = Boxcars::GoogleSearch.new
s.run "what temperature is it in Phoenix?"
```

```{ruby}
require 'active_support'

engine = Boxcars::Openai.new(max_tokens: 256)
calc = Boxcars::Calculator.new(engine: engine)
puts calc.run "what is pi to the forth power divided by 22.1?"
```

It is necessary to add gem 'activesupport' to call blank?.
